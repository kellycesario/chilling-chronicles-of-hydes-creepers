# Chilling Chronicles of Hyde's Creepers

## Installation

To run the project:

1. Run `pnpm dev` in the main directory
2. Obtain an API key from Contentful by creating an account and setting up the necessary content types (chronicle, additionalInformation, category)
3. Fill your `.env` file with the Contentful API keys

## Usage

This project showcases the integration of Next.js 13 (App Router) with Contentful, creating a **`Chilling Blog`** featuring authentic reviews of 20 books by Edgar J Hyde (Creepers saga). This application, in a way, combines the author's previous background in Linguistics with the ongoing studies in Systems Analysis and Development.

If you need more information about integrating with Contentful, visit the [README](/src/contentful/README.md) in the `'src/contentful'` directory.
