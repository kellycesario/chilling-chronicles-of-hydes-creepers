## About the Project

This project showcases the integration of Next.js 13 (App Router) with Contentful, creating a **`Chilling Blog`** featuring authentic reviews of 20 books by Edgar J Hyde (Creepers saga). This application, in a way, combines the author's previous background in Linguistics with the ongoing studies in Systems Analysis and Development.

If you need more information about integrating with Contentful, visit the [README](/src/contentful/README.md) in the `'src/contentful'` directory.
